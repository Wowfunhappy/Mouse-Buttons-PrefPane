# A UI-less fork of SensibleSideButtons for Mountain Lion and Mavericks

---

# Instructions

## 1. Mount the DMG, and copy *Side Button Enabler* to a location on your hard drive.
(Most people would probably copy it to the `Applications` folder, but I like to copy invisible utilities like this one in a different location, so `Applications` stays clean. You should do what works for you!)

## 2. Grant *Side Button Enabler* permission to control your computer:

**Mountain Lion**:

Open `System Preferences` →  `Accessability`, and check the box labeled "Enable access for assistive devices"
    
**Mavericks**:

Open `System Preferences` → `Security & Privacy` → `Accessability`, and add *Side Button Enabler* to the list of apps allowed to control your computer.

## 3. Tell you Mac to open *Side Button Enabler* at log in:

Open `System Preferences` → `Users & Groups` → `Login Items`, and add *Side Bar Enabler* to the list of apps that open when you log in.

## 4. Run the *Side Button Enabler* app.

The M4 and M5 buttons on your mouse should now work as `Forward` and `Back` buttons. If they don't, try using Activity Monitor to close *Side Button Enabler*, and then open it again. If the buttons still don't work, double check that *Side Button Enabler* is allowed to control your computer.

# Theoretical FAQs

Q: What is a "theoretical" FAQ?  
A: A question no one has asked me, but theoretically could.  

Q: Why did you make this?  
A: Because I wanted to use SensibleSideButtons on Mavericks.

Q: Why is there no UI?  
A: The original app's UI was built using storyboards. Storyboards don't work on Mavericks.

Q: Did you know this code is terrible?  
A: No, but I'm not surprised. I don't actually know how to program in Objective C, I just deleted a bunch of code. (And moved a bunch of code that I later realized didn't need to be moved.)

Q: This app is great, who do I thank?  
A: The original developer, archagon. Go to http://sensible-side-buttons.archagon.net for more information. He accepts donations.

Q: This app is awful, who do I hate?  
A: Definately *not* archagon, it's probably my fault. You can hate me, if you want, as long as you don't tell me. It would hurt my feelings. :(
