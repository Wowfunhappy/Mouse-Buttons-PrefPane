# A UI-less fork of SensibleSideButtons for Mac OS X 10.8+

---

# Instructions

## 1. Mount the DMG, and copy *Side Button Enabler* to your Utilities folder.
(Or to any other location on your hard drive.)

## 2. Grant *Side Button Enabler* permission to control your computer:

**Mac OS X 10.8:**:  
Open `System Preferences` →  `Accessability`, and check the box labeled "Enable access for assistive devices"
    
**Mac OS X 10.9 and later:**:  
Open `System Preferences` → `Security & Privacy` → `Accessability`, and add *Side Button Enabler* to the list of apps allowed to control your computer.

## 3. Tell you Mac to open *Side Button Enabler* at log in:

Open `System Preferences` → `Users & Groups` → `Login Items`, and add *Side Bar Enabler* to the list of apps that open when you log in.

## 4. Run the *Side Button Enabler* app.

The M4 and M5 buttons on your mouse should now work as `Forward` and `Back` buttons. Hold down the middle mouse button (M3) to enable side buttons's native functionality (useful if the side buttons are set up as shortcuts in Mission Control).

# Troubleshooting

Buttons don't work? Try using Activity Monitor to quit *Side Button Enabler*, and then open it again. If they still don't work, double check that *Side Button Enabler* is allowed to control your computer.

# Theoretical FAQs

Q: Why did you make this?  
A: Primarily because I wanted to use SensibleSideButtons on Mavericks. The original version is only compatible with 10.10 Yosemite and above. I also added the ability to hold down the middle mouse button to enable the side buttons's native functionaity, which allows me to use the Mission Control shortcuts I set up in System Preferences.

Q: Why is there no UI?  
A: The original app's UI was built using storyboards. Storyboards don't work on Mavericks.

Q: This app is great, who do I thank?  
A: The original developer, archagon. Go to http://sensible-side-buttons.archagon.net for more information. He accepts donations.

Q: This app is awful, who do I hate?  
A: Definately *not* archagon, please don't contact him, we have no relation! You can hate me, if you want, as long as you don't tell me. It would hurt my feelings. :(
